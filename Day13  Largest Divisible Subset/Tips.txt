The key concept here is:
Given a set of integers that satisfies the property that each pair of integers inside the set are mutually divisible, for a new integer S, S can be placed into the set as long as it can divide the smallest number of the set or is divisible by the largest number of the set.

For example, let's say we have a set P = { 4, 8, 16 }, P satisfies the divisible condition. Now consider a new number 2, it can divide the smallest number 4, so it can be placed into the set; similarly, 32 can be divided by 16, the biggest number in P, it can also placed into P.

Next, let's define:

EDIT: For clarification, the following definitions try to enlarge candidate solutions by appending a larger element at the end of each potential set, while my implementation below is prefixing a smaller element at the front of a set. Conceptually they are equivalent but by adding smaller elements at the front saves the trouble for keeping the correct increasing order for the final answer. Please refer to comments in code for more details.

For an increasingly sorted array of integers a[1 .. n]

T[n] = the length of the largest divisible subset whose largest number is a[n]

T[n+1] = max{ 1 + T[i] if a[n+1] mod a[i] == 0 else 1 }

Now, deducting T[n] becomes straight forward with a DP trick. For the final result we will need to maintain a backtrace array for the answer.
