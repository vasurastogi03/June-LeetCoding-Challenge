First, check the four border of the matrix. If there is a element is
'O', alter it and all its neighbor 'O' elements to '1'.

Then ,alter all the 'O' to 'X'

At last,alter all the '1' to 'O'

For example:

         X X X X           X X X X             X X X X
         X X O X  ->       X X O X    ->       X X X X
         X O X X           X 1 X X             X O X X
         X O X X           X 1 X X             X O X X
